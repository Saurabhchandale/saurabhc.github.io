About
- I’m a Data Analyst who cares about clean data, reproducible analysis, and clear storytelling.
- I work with SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy), visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), and dashboarding platforms (Power BI / Tableau).
- I extract insights from messy data and turn them into decisions: dashboards, reports, and automated analyses.

What I do
- Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and ETL
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Data visualization and dashboarding
- Automating reports and building reproducible notebooks

Featured projects
- [Sales-Insights-Dashboard](https://github.com/your/sales-insights) — Sales ETL, cohort analysis & interactive Power BI dashboard (SQL, Python, Power BI)
- [Customer-Churn-Analysis](https://github.com/your/churn-analysis) — Churn prediction exploratory analysis and feature engineering (Pandas, scikit-learn)
- [Marketing-A/B-Report](https://github.com/your/ab-testing) — A/B test analysis with Bayesian and frequentist approaches + clear decision rules (Jupyter Notebook, Plotly)

Selected highlights
- Reduced report generation time from 2 days to 15 minutes by automating ETL + reporting pipelines.
- Built a customer segmentation model that increased targeted campaign CTR by 12%.
- Produced an executive dashboard used weekly by product and growth teams.

Skills & tools

How I present my work
- Clean, documented Jupyter notebooks with a one-page executive summary
- Reproducible analysis: scripts + requirements + small sample data
- Interactive dashboards for non-technical stakeholders (Power BI / Tableau)

How to navigate my repos
- Each project contains:
  - README with TL;DR, dataset link, steps to reproduce

Small ask
If you find my work useful, consider starring the repo — it helps my projects reach others who might benefit.

Current status
- Open to data analyst roles, freelance analytics projects, and collaborations on data-driven product features.

If you want, I can now:
- Replace the placeholders with your real project names, repo links, short descriptions and one key metric for each project.
- Generate polished project READMEs (with examples, reproducible steps, badges and a demo GIF) for 1–3 projects you pick.
- Create a simple GitHub Pages portfolio site (HTML + CSS) or a single-page static site you can host.
